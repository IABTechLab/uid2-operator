# UID2 Operator


The UID 2 Project is subject to Tech Lab IPRâ€™s Policy and is managed by the IAB Tech Lab Addressability Working Group and Privacy & Rearc Commit Group. Please review the governance rules [here](https://github.com/IABTechLab/uid2-core/blob/master/Software%20Development%20and%20Release%20Procedures.md)

## Prerequisite

To setup dependencies before building, run the follow script

```bash
./setup_dependencies.sh
```

## Building

To run unit tests:

```
mvn clean test
```

To package application:

```
mvn package
```

To run application:

- use `conf/local-config.json` to run standalone operator service 
  for local debugging, which loads salts, keys and optout from mock storage provider, and doesn't communicate with uid2-core and uid2-optout.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dvertx-config-path=conf/local-config.json
```

- use `conf/integ-config.json` to run optout operator that
  integrates with uid2-core (default runs on `localhost:8088`) and uid2-optout  (default runs on `localhost:8081`)

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dvertx-config-path=conf/integ-config.json
```
## Local deployment/testing on Docker
1. Change `COPY ./conf/default-config.json /app/conf/` in line 13 of `Dockerfile` to `COPY ./conf/docker-config.json /app/conf/local-config.json`
2. Run ```mvn package```
3. Go to `pom.xml` and find the version wrapped under `<version>` tag
4. Run ```docker build -t uid-operator --build-arg JAR_VERSION={version you find in step 3} .```
5. Run ```docker run -it -p 8080:8080 uid-operator:latest ```
6. Go to postman and test on endpoint `http://localhost:8080/v1/token/generate?email=exampleuser4@test.uidapi.com`
