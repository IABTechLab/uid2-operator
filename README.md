## Prerequisite

To setup dependencies before building, run the follow script

```bash
./setup_dependencies.sh
```

## Building

To run unit tests:

```
mvn clean test
```

To package application:

```
mvn package
```

To run application:

- use `conf/local-config.json` to run standalone operator service 
  for local debugging, which loads salts, keys and optout from mock storage provider, and doesn't communicate with uid2-core and uid2-optout.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dvertx-config-path=conf/local-config.json
```

- use `conf/integ-config.json` to run optout operator that
  integrates with uid2-core (default runs on `localhost:8088`) and uid2-optout  (default runs on `localhost:8081`)

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dvertx-config-path=conf/integ-config.json
```
